        "Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document. Using machine learning for language identification was a difficult task a few years ago because there was not a lot of data on languages, but with the availability of data with ease, several powerful machine learning models are already available for language identification. So, if you want to learn how to train a machine learning model for language detection, then this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of language detection with machine learning using Python."
